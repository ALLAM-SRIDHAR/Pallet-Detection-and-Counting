# Pallets Detection and Counting using Computer Vision

**Business Problem:** A leading global pallet manufacturing company faces inventory challenges due to inaccurate counting of stacked pallets in warehouses. Manual and semi-automated methods are inefficient, causing stock discrepancies, delays, and higher costs. Traditional scanning fails to track stacked pallets, impacting real-time visibility, order fulfillment, and logistics. As operations grow a precise and efficient inventory management solution is crucial.

**Business Objective:** Minimize the latency of count and Maximize Precision accuracy
**Business Constraint:** Minimize Processing Time

**Business Success Criteria:** Achieve 25% reduction in overall warehouse operational costs, including labor and counting inefficiencies.
**Machine Learning Success Criteria:** Achieve at least 95% model accuracy with an inference timeof I second per frame.
**Economic Success Criteria:** Achieve reduction in operational costs, including labor and inventory loss.
