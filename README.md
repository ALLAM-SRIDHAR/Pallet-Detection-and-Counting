# üì¶ Pallet Detection and Counting Using Computer Vision

## üß† Project Overview
This project addresses the problem of inaccurate pallet counting in warehouses using deep learning and computer vision. A custom object detection model is trained to detect and count stacked pallets in real-time from warehouse images.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

Manual and semi-automated pallet counting methods often result in:
- Stock discrepancies
- Fulfillment delays
- High operational costs

Traditional scanners fail to detect **stacked pallets**, especially under low lighting or occlusions. As operations scale, accuracy becomes critical.

## üöÄ Objectives & Goals

- ‚úÖ Achieve **‚â•95% model accuracy**
- ‚úÖ Detect and count pallets with **‚â§1 sec inference time**
- ‚úÖ Reduce warehouse operational costs by **25‚Äì30%**


**Business Objective:** Minimize the latency of count and Maximize Precision accuracy

**Business Constraint:** Minimize Processing Time

**Business Success Criteria:** Achieve 25% reduction in overall warehouse operational costs, including labor and counting inefficiencies.

**Machine Learning Success Criteria:** Achieve at least 95% model accuracy with an inference timeof I second per frame.

**Economic Success Criteria:** Achieve reduction in operational costs, including labor and inventory loss.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ALLAM-SRIDHAR/Pallet-Detection-and-Counting.git
cd Pallet-Detection-and-Counting

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run detection
python detect.py --source path_to_image_or_video

# (Optional) Deploy API
python app.py


**Note:** My origial dataset consisted of 217 images which i cannot upload directly github due to length of file, so i am uploading it to my drive and here is its link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cHx6z0SrabNGrAot_GIBWTmRtywCFs48/view?usp=sharing

Data Preprocessing, Data Annotation, Data Augumentation, etc is done in Roboflow application.
